        <h2>Reasons why AI is great:</h2>
            <p align ="center"> AI, also known as Artifical Intelligence, is important to society and our development as humans, as it makes it possible for machines to learn from experience, adjust to new inputs and perform human like tasks. Most AI that you hear about today - from chess-playing computers to self-drivivng cars - rely heavily on deep learning and natural language processing. Using these technologies, computers can be trained to accomplish specific tasks processing large amounts of data and recognising patterns in the data.</p>
